# Mash a Mouse

A Svelte implementation of Whack a Mole.

## Credits

The project was conceived and made during work hours at Knowit Objectnet. If you'd like to join us or some of the other Knowit Norway companies, send us an [email](mailto:hei@knowit.no).

The user interface was designed by my co-worker, Birgitte Rishatt.

It is based on the Svelte template, a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It
lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)...

```bash
cd svelte-app
yarn install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a
component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
